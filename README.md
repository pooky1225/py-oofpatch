# py-oofpatch
patch roblox's sounds folder to have the old (better) oof sound
windows only

i made this after suffering to make my first python project
8/10 would google search again

i'd like to shout out https://github.com/zer0mania/roblox-oof-patcher, didn't know they made this already.

usage:
if you're a nerd you can run the source patch.py
- run the executable (patch.exe or patch.py)
- thats literally it

make an issue if the file no longer exists 

update 1:
move off discord, screw that shit

update 2: 
its 1am. i bricked my roblox 3 times because i had a typo in my code. did you know using /blob/ instead of /raw/ writes html to an ogg file? its crazy. anyhow its automated now. 

update 3:
now writes exists.txt so you dont patch a patched instance.
