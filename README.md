# py-oofpatch
patch roblox's sounds folder to have the old (better) oof sound

windows only

i made this after suffering to make my first python project

8/10 would google search again

i'd like to shout out https://github.com/zer0mania/roblox-oof-patcher, didn't know they made this already.

usage:
if you're a nerd you can run the source patch.py
- run the executable (patch.exe or patch.py)
- thats literally it

update 1:
move off discord, screw that shit

update 2: 
its 1am. i bricked my roblox 3 times because i had a typo in my code. did you know using /blob/ instead of /raw/ writes html to an ogg file? its crazy. anyhow its automated now. 

update 3:
now writes exists.txt so you dont patch a patched instance. 

update 4:
you ever just realize roblox doesn't get rid of old version folders? fixed bug where multiple version folders could be picked rendering my code to bug out. anyhow it picks only the latest version folder now
