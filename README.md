# py-oofpatch
patch roblox's sounds folder to have the old (better) oof sound
windows only (for a bit)


i made this after suffering to make my first python project
8/10 would google search again

usage:
if you're a nerd you can run the source patch.py
- run the executable (patch.exe or patch.py)
- when it asks, input your versions-xxx folder
- thats literally it

make an issue if the file no longer exists (i used discord cdn as my file host which is probably stupid)
